Hi, Thank you for the opportunity.

The project needs a lot of work done still, and since the database was used locally using workbench it won't properly show on your end.
I was very excited to deploy everything to Heroku in time, but I was too ambitious. 

Instructions
1. download the code (either clone or zip file)
2. open the folder in code editor
3. open terminal and enter in the followings:
4. cd server
5. npm i
6. npm run devstart
7. open another terminal and enter in the followings:
8. cd client
9. npm i
10. npm run start

I have made a mistake of putting navbar and nav into components, but it was too late to take them all out. 
I will still work on this project later to fix any problems and deploying it. 
If you are still interested you can always come checkout my github later :)
